            Of all my experiences, I have been most impacted by my study abroad in Asia during the summer of 2014. For the first 6 weeks, I studied at the National University of Singapore&mdash;a world class university&mdash;in first-world Singapore. The next 6 weeks I spent studying at Beijing Jiatong University and immersing myself in Chinese culture.
            </p>
            <p class="medium-6 large-4 end columns">I traveled to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and several other cities in China and made lasting friendships with many Chinese nationals. In fact, I am still learning Chinese over a year later and regularly talking with friends from China.

                <p>
                During my final year at Georgia Tech, I was fortunate enough to have two excellent data science professors who piqued my interest in the topic.

                During my final year at Georgia Tech, I was fortunate enough to have two excellent data science professors who piqued my interest in the topic.
                </p>
                <p>The first professor teaches an introductory data visualization course and has an infectious passion for data viz. He opened my eyes to terrible graphs that people create every day without thinking (the pie chart) and provided useful principles for proper data visualization (Tufte's principles).

                <p>
                The second professor's course provided exposure to a variety of tasks that a data scientist might be expected to perform such as creating databases, building a custom visualization with D3.js, using an API that gives access to movie data, and cleaning data with OpenRefine.

                During my last semester at Georgia Tech, I flew to California for the Strata + Hadoop World conference. Needless to say, I am very interested in data visualization, data analytics, and other data science topics.
