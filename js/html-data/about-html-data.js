Its culture can be seen in action when a twenty-year-old scout goes out of his way to help a distressed motorist.

It can be seen when an eighty-year-old scout is a friend and mentor to someone seven decades younger. </p> <p> This trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent culture is the best part of scouting. </p>'
