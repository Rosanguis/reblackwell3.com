                        Of all my experiences, I have been most impacted by my study abroad in Asia during the summer of 2014. For the first 6 weeks, I studied at the National University of Singapore&mdash;a world class university&mdash;in first-world Singapore. The next 6 weeks I spent studying at Beijing Jiatong University and immersing myself in Chinese culture.

                        During my final year at Georgia Tech, I was fortunate enough to have two excellent data science professors who piqued my interest in the topic.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first professor teaches an introductory data visualization course and has an infectious passion for data viz. He opened my eyes to terrible graphs that people create every day without thinking (the pie chart) and provided useful principles for proper data visualization (Tufte's principles).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The second professor's course provided exposure to a variety of tasks that a data scientist might be expected to perform such as creating databases, building a custom visualization with D3.js, using an API that gives access to movie data, and cleaning data with OpenRefine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        During my last semester at Georgia Tech, I flew to California for the Strata + Hadoop World conference. Needless to say, I am very interested in data visualization, data analytics, and other data science topics.

                    To better understand my role as a Java developer within NetControl's Equipment division, a short history lesson is in order. In the 1960's, programmers built Transportation Control System in COBOL (a programming language that is no longer prevalent) and ran it on a mainframe. Nearly 40 years later, the decision was made to replace this mainframe program written in an outdated language with a modern program written in Java that can run on a distributed computer system instead of an expensive mainframe. NetControl, as the project is called, is a $200 million project that has been active since 2006. It was originally intended to be a 10 year project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    NetControl Equipment has the responsibility of recreating the software pertaining to equipment (i.e. railcars and their contents) that exists in the 1960's COBOL code. The software modules created by the equipment group are integral to the larger NetControl project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Specifically addressing my role within Union Pacific Railroad, I use Java to build micro-services that connect to other micro-services in NetControl Equipment to accomplish complex tasks. NetControl is designed as an intricate web of services that each do one specific task and all combine to perform larger tasks.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    First, we employ the Agile model to plan ahead and manage our expected workload. On a more technical note, we use Maven to standardize our build process and manage dependencies and Spring for dependency injection. Our project uses Subversion for source control. We are also sure to thoroughly unit test our programs, and we use JUnit for the testing and JMock for mocking classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I am very pleased by the fact that Union Pacific aims to improve the quality of its code and developers by frequently having code reviews. As a new developer, code reviews have been an excellent resource to quickly learn industry standards and finding ways to write more readable code.

                        I spent 3 months in Asia over the summer of 2014 on a study abroad trip in China and Singapore. I also had a chance to visit Indonesia for several days.
                        </p>

                        The first part of the study abroad trip was in Singapore. I quickly fell in love with Singapore because it is a (disturbingly clean) first-world country with delicious food from a variety of countries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The next part of the trip was in China. China was definitely not as clean as Singapore, but it still had excellent food. I met many Chinese friends and was able to travel to several cities outside of Beijing, including Shanghai and Guangzhou, with Chinese friends. I got an authentic look into China, and I am aching to visit again.

                            When I was 18, my dad made me a deal that if I would plan a trip to Europe for the two of us, we would travel there over the summer. Obviously this was a great deal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I spent a few weeks reading about the different cities in Europe and deciding where we would go and what we would see. After replacing some of the planned cities with places that would allow us to do most of the travel by train, which is much cheaper than planes, we left for Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We saw a staggering number of cities (probably around 20) and an even more staggering number of museums. In total, we traveled to over 10 countries in roughly 7 weeks. We traveled as far north as Copenhagen, as far east as Budapest, as far south and west as Lisbon, as far Catholic as the Vatican, as stoned as Amsterdam, and as snobby as Paris.

                <p> The road from Scout to Eagle Scout is long and takes years to complete. Picking up merit badges along its path helps you acquire valuable skills that can help you handle emergencies, manage your finances, or just cook for yourself. Gaining the badges truly does help scouts learn practical skills, but I would argue that scounting is so much more than the sum of a few skills. </p>

It can be seen when a teenage scout looks a shopowner in the eyes and tells him that he received too much change. It can be seen when an eighty-year-old scout is a friend and mentor to someone seven decades younger. </p> <p> This trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent culture is the best part of scouting. </p>
