                        <p>I work on a project that has become one of several critical software projects for Union Pacific. The project was started over 10 years ago and will replace an existing, difficult to maintain, service built in the 1970's. NetControl, as the project is called, keeps track of varied details about the railroad that allow Union Pacific to ensure that it knows what is being shipped on each of its trains and the destination of that cargo.</p>
                        <p>My specific group is NetControl Equipment, which is building the software that maintains all of the box cars, flat cars, hoppers, and other types of cargo moving equipment. The software also keeps inventory of what is inside each one of these cars.</p>
                        <p>The NetControl model uses small distributed services that do one particular task, such as generating one specific report that enables trains to be authorized to leave a depot. My job is to build the Java back-end for these micro-services.</p>

                        NetControl developers utilize many of the same technologies to provide a more standardized working environment that is better for large projects. We employ the Agile model with one month sprints to stay organized as a project and make it easy to know what we are doing now and what we will do next.
                        </p>
                        <p>The project is coded in Java, and we use a number of Java helper technologies to make our code easier to write and maintain. First, we use Maven to simplify the build process and manage dependencies. We also use Spring for dependency injection. Our company is partial to using Subversion over Git, so we use that.</p>
                        <p>As a project and a company, we are strongly in favor of using unit tests to ensure that code does what it is supposed to do. Union Pacific also makes use of code reviews to improve the quality of development code. As a new developer, I have found these code reviews to be tremendously valuable as a way to learn industry standards.</p>

                <p> The road from Scout to Eagle Scout is long and takes years to complete. Picking up merit badges along its path helps you acquire valuable skills that can help you handle emergencies, manage your finances, or just cook for yourself. Gaining the badges truly does help scouts learn practical skills, but I would argue that scounting is so much more than the sum of a few skills. </p>

                <p> Scouting has a culture, just like every other group. Its culture can be seen in action when a twenty-year-old scout goes out of his way to help a distressed motorist. It can be seen when a teenage scout looks a shopowner in the eyes and tells him that he received too much change. It can be seen when an eighty-year-old scout is a friend and mentor to someone seven decades younger. </p> <p> This trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent culture is the best part of scouting. </p>
