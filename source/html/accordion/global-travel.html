                I spent 3 months in Asia over the summer of 2014 on a study abroad trip in China and Singapore. I also had a chance to visit Indonesia for several days.

                The first part of the study abroad trip was in Singapore. I quickly fell in love with Singapore because it is a (disturbingly clean) first-world country with delicious food from a variety of countries.

                The next part of the trip was in China. China was definitely not as clean as Singapore, but it still had excellent food. I met many Chinese friends and was able to travel to several cities outside of Beijing, including Shanghai and Guangzhou, with Chinese friends. I got an authentic look into China, and I am aching to visit again.

                When I was 18, my dad made me a deal that if I would plan a trip to Europe for the two of us, we would travel there over the summer. Obviously this was a great deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                I spent a few weeks reading about the different cities in Europe and deciding where we would go and what we would see. After replacing some of the planned cities with places that would allow us to do most of the travel by train, which is much cheaper than planes, we left for Europe.

                We saw a staggering number of cities (probably around 20) and an even more staggering number of museums. In total, we traveled to over 10 countries in roughly 7 weeks. We traveled as far north as Copenhagen, as far east as Budapest, as far south and west as Lisbon, as far Catholic as the Vatican, as stoned as Amsterdam, and as snobby as Paris.

                Growing up, I was lucky enough to have parents that loved to travel and wanted to expose me and my sister to new experiences. Every summer, we would travel to a different area of the United States and tour the surrounding states in a rental car.

                My parents wanted my sister and I to visit all 50 US states before we turned 18. After years and years of these summer road trips, my sister and I visited our 50th state: New Mexico.

                Traveling to Canada, Mexico, Caribbean islands, and all 50 US states was a fun family bonding experience. I got a sample of life in different places throughout the United States and other countries in North America. I thoroughly enjoyed the experiences.
