                <p>I spent 3 months in Asia during 2014. They were the most exciting days of my life and I treausure my time exploring China, Singapore, and Indonesia. I was lucky enough to meet kind people in China who helped me explore authentic Chinese culture.

                I was confused a large percentage of the time in China because everyone around me, including my hosts, was speaking Mandarin or Cantonese. I am continuing to learn Mandarin Chinese so I have a better shot of not being confused next time.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: Though Mandarin Chinese is often considered one of the most difficult languages for Westerners to learn, its grammar is much simpler than most Western languages. In fact, verbs do not even need to be conjugated.<p>

                <p>When I was 18, my dad and I spent 7 weeks in Europe and visited over 10 countries. I planned the trip to maximize the number of interesting things we could see every day. We stuck to my schedule for maybe a week before we were tired of seeing art museums. Afterwards we used the schedule but didn&rsquo;t follow it religiously.
                </p>
                <p>The trip was great since we got to visit so many simultaneously modern and historic cities: London, Paris, Rome, Berlin, Amsterdam, Prague, etc.

                <p>Every summer when I was in elementary, middle, and high school, my family would take a vacation to a particular region of the United States and see a cluster of states. They wanted to take me and my sister to all 50 states before we turned 18. And I am happy to say they succeeded. Learning about the United States through travel has been great. The most important thing I learned is that Southerners are the friendliest. But I&rsquo;m from Atlanta, so I already knew that.

                I have also visited Canada and Mexico as well as a variety of Caribbean island nations.
