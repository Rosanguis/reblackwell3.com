            <p>I studied abroad during the summer of 2014 for 6 weeks in China and 6 weeks in Singapore. This was my most impactful experience at Georgia Tech. I made lasting connections with people abroad who showed me the similarities and differences between Asian, primarily Chinese, and Western culture. In fact, I still study Mandarin Chinese and message with Chinese friends in Mandarin and English nearly daily.</p>

            <p>During my final year at Georgia Tech, I took an interest in data science. I had an excellent professor for a data visualization class and another great professor for a challenging analytics course. The next semester I attended the Strata Hadoop World conference in California. (For the most part it was over my head.) My interest in data science has not wavered, and I am finding avenues to improve my skills and experience in data visualization and analysis.</p>
