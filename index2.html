                <p> The road from Scout to Eagle Scout is long and takes years to complete. Picking up merit badges along its path helps you acquire valuable skills that can help you handle emergencies, manage your finances, or just cook for yourself. Gaining the badges truly does help scouts learn practical skills, but I would argue that scounting is so much more than the sum of a few skills. </p>

                <p> Scouting has a culture, just like every other group. Its culture can be seen in action when a twenty-year-old scout goes out of his way to help a distressed motorist. It can be seen when a teenage scout looks a shopowner in the eyes and tells him that he received too much change. It can be seen when an eighty-year-old scout is a friend and mentor to someone seven decades younger. </p> <p> This trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent culture is the best part of scouting. </p>
